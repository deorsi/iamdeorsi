Hello World!


I'm not particularly inclined to talk about myself, as I believe it's not my thing.


However.


I will share a few thoughts in the following lines. Feel free to read at your discretion.


Nature emerged from the quantum vacuum, giving birth to atoms that eventually combined to form the Universe we live in, including us, Homo sapiens. A few centuries ago, certain individuals chose not to share their knowledge with humanity. This led to most people living their lives according to the visions of others, controlled by kings, corporations, and brands.


Sounds familiar, doesn't it?


Well, not quite.


Today, we have the power to decide what information we consume.

Thanks to the internet, we can explore and select from a vast array of knowledge, learn, think critically, and ask questions to ultimately decide what we believe in and stand for.


With this in mind, I'd like to mention that around 200 years ago, humanity discovered that the foundation of the universe is not simply a particle or a solid, tangible object.


We are waves.


Everything that exists is comprised of quantum waves of potential realities. Similar to atoms, we function as both particles (objects moving in the known physical "local" space, this 3D universe) and waves (information resonating in the "non-local" space yet to be explored, spanning all other dimensions).


You don't have to take my word for it. Conduct your own research, and you'll eventually uncover this ultimate reality.


Regardless of whether you've read this or not, I wish you all the best the universe has to offer.


Now...


It's time for you to choose and decide what is best for you.


Begin crafting your life's journey.


Deorsi.

Hello World! (again...)


So much has changed after I decided to take fate into my own hands... I'm glad the universe responded pretty well.


I took a leap, changed careers, moved into technology. With each step, opportunities opened up. 


I found myself able to work from anywhere, needing only a computer and an internet connection. This newfound freedom brought security, both financial and personal, beyond what I’d known before. 
And most importantly, I found my way to family, to love. Life expanded, and suddenly, I had something truly beautiful to nurture and protect.

The world, too, is evolving, faster than ever. AI began to take root in the world around us. The information age has grown, and the choices we make in it resonate deeply. 


As ever, it’s up to us to decide what we let in, what we stand for, what we pursue.


Whether these words speak to you or not, my wish remains the same: may you find what you seek.


Now…


It’s your turn again. Choose with intention. 

This is your journey.


Deorsi.
