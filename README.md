Hello, World!

I don't really wanna talk about myself, I think that's not for me.

But. 

I will say some things on the lines that follows. Read at your will.

The Earth is the place where we are now. The Nature have emerged from Quantum Vacuum to become atoms that later combined together to form the Universe with us, homo sapiens, in it. A few hundreds years ago, some idiots decided to fuck us all, by not sharing their knowledge with humanity. Before the internet, the majority of us was living life by someone else's vision, ruled by kings, corporations and brands. 

Ow, right... Just like today, uhm?

No.

Today, we can choose what to feed into our senses. 

With the internet we can search and pick on any knowledge, learn, reason and question about and then decide what to believe and stand for. Having said that, I gotta say that around a bit more than 200 years ago, us humans, have discovered that the thing that make everything in the Universe, is not just a particle, an solid material object or piece of meat. We are waves. All that exist are remain in quantuum waves of possible realities. Just like the atom, we behave like particles (objects moving in the known physical "local" space, this 3D Universe)  and waves (information resonating in the "non-local" space yet to be known, all other dimensions).

You don't need to believe me. Search for yourself and you'll eventually find out that is the ultimate reality.

If you read this (or not) I wish you all the possible good things in the Universe.

Now.

You gotta choose and decide what is good for you.

Start creating your life.

Deorsi.
